            <h3><span>About Me.</span></h3>
            <p>Hello there! I'm Panagiotis Xiropotamos, though my friends know me as Panos.
                Born and raised in Athens, Greece, I am now a 24-year old masters student at
                the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. Graduated from the University
                of Patras as a Biologist, I now find myself at the intersection of Biology and Computer 
                Science dedicated to translating raw data into meaningful knowledge, bridging the gap 
                between computational analysis and biological relevance.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to my professional and academic goals, I am deeply passionate about travel 
                and food. Escaping the routine of Athens for brief two-day excursions provides me with 
                relaxing breaks and the opportunities to explore the diverse landscapes of Greece, but never 
                adverse to longer escapes on inspiring trips abroad. As for food, I find cooking to be a source 
                of composure, offering a temporary escape from the stresses of daily life. I am always eager
                 to try new cuisines, constantly seeking out culinary adventures that enrich my experiences.
            </p>
