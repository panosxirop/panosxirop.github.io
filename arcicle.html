            <h3><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar3131">Single-cell reconstruction of developmental trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis <i class="fa-solid fa-paperclip"></a></i></h3>
            <p>As embryos develop, numerous cell types with distinct functions and morphologies arise from 
                pluripotent cells. Three research groups have used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the
                 transcriptional changes accompanying development of vertebrate embryos 
                 . Wagner et al. sequenced the transcriptomes of more than 90,000 cells throughout 
                 zebrafish development to reveal how cells differentiate during axis patterning, germ layer 
                 formation, and early organogenesis. Farrell et al. profiled the transcriptomes of tens of 
                 thousands of embryonic cells and applied a computational approach to construct a branching 
                 tree describing the transcriptional trajectories that lead to 25 distinct zebrafish cell types.
                  The branching tree revealed how cells change their gene expression as they become more and 
                  more specialized. Briggs et al. examined whole frog embryos, spanning zygotic genome activation
                   through early organogenesis, to map cell states and differentiation across all cell lineages 
                   over time. These data and approaches pave the way for the comprehensive reconstruction of 
                   transcriptional trajectories during development.</p>
            <p>The results of a single-cell RNA-sequencing experiment is practically a table of cells and corresponding
                for genes representing gene expression. In this plot (UR Diagram) the research teams have merge such data from 
                twelve timepoints of the Zebrafish' embryonic development. From a meaningless table of gene counts, they have managed to 
                reconstruct the developmental trajectories of each of the 25 cell types and also with thw use of different colors for the developmental stages,
                they prove the dynamic nature of puripotent stem cells to differentiate and structure a multicellular organism.
