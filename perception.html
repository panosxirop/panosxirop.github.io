            <h3><a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tg/2022/01/09552195/1xic0yNxnws"> Perception! Immersion! Empowerment! Superpowers as Inspiration for Visualization<i class="fa-solid fa-paperclip"></a></i></h3>
            <p>
                The article emphasizes the basic cognitive methods for inspiration and empowerment
                 in general in the field of visualizations, studying the dynamics of perception. 
                 In the first contact with the text, the cognitive skills for empowering the visualizations
                  are presented as definitions, examples, but also with references to movies and comics,
                   a fact that I confess made it difficult for me to follow the flow of the text, which
                    as a person with minimal contact with either of those, had a hard time relating the
                     abilities to the references included. Despite the difficulty it caused me while reading, 
                     figures 2 and 3 as well as the descriptive images on the dimensions of cognitive empowerment,
                      combined with the real-life examples helped me to understand the basic principles for optimizing 
                      visualizations. So I was able to perceive the visualization as a whole and not just as a result, 
                      but as a way of conveying a message.Through the examples, I realized the presence and need of 
                      visualization in everyday life, but also the impact that they could have, if developed 
                      correctly and with the user perception in mind. Augmented vision and synesthesia combined 
                      with the user standard vision can significantly change the perception of the end user.
                       The take-home message that I will try to integrate more into my visualizations is 
                       information richness, and not so much the data quantity, while also depending on the
                        message and the audience I want to reach, I will try to differentially integrate the 
                        rest of the mentioned empowerment dimensions to create as meaningful visualizations as possible for the end user.
